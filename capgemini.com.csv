				Reports
				Aerospace and defense organizations show growing confidence in Digital Twin technology with 40% investment increase
				New research from the Capgemini Research Institute – ‘Mirroring Reality: Digital Twins in aerospace and defense’ – reports that aerospace and defense (A&D) investment in digital twins has increased by 40% in the last financial year, representing 2.7% of these organizations’ revenues. This is driven by a growing confidence in the technology’s ability to drive benefits beyond the product design phase and across the entire value chain through manufacturing and into ongoing operations. The benefits of digital twins in helping to achieve sustainability goals were also cited by two-thirds of A&D businesses.
