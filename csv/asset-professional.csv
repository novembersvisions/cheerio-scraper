Disciplined Investment and Financial Plan Management For Busy People. 
Build A Plan Around What’s Important To You, Stress-Test It Against A Thousand Market Scenarios
†
, And Get Disciplined And Experienced Financial Guidance You Can Count On The First Time.
 

If you're like most successful people.. 
A Lot Depends On You..
Your family, your employees, and your community look to you 
for the right answers when it matters most. You’ve probably used personal financial advisors, and business financial advisors before.


You're Passionate..
You’re driven by a higher purpose than just money. You want your life to be more, and have lots of goals to conquer. You know any financial advisors or business consultant you work with must
 understand that.


You're Intelligent..
You know yourself, your skillset, your finances, and your business. You value advisors around you who can help you reach your potential by showing you what’s in your blind spot and helping you achieve your
 goals. 


You're Limited On Time..
You know there are a dozen things in life more important than money, but
 most of them cost money. You’re looking to add time back to your day by working with a financial advisor, business consultant, and tax planner who can handle your specific situation under one roof.
You know the importance of having a plan in place.. 
You Need To Stay Proactive
Time doesn’t wait for anyone, and bad news doesn’t get better with time. You’re committed to your financial future, and feel comfortable getting guidance from your financial advisor who helps you
 think about the road ahead.


You Need To Be Prepared
Life is subject to change without notice, and you don’t have time or bandwidth to constantly put out “fires” in your financial life. You’ve lived enough life to know
 that an ounce of preparation will always be more than worth a pound of the cure.


You Need To Stay Informed
You know changes can happen very quickly and put your situation in turmoil. Staying informed about your financial life is paramount
 to your comfort, clarity, and security. 


You Need To Stay On Track
Dealing with a busy professional life, or running a business means that things can become “out of sight, out of mind” if you’re not careful. Your financial advisor needs to work to keep you on track
, even when you’re unable to focus on it from life’s requirements.
 

You want to be a good financial steward, but it's like the more you make..the less you get to keep.. 
Taxes that never seem to go down..
Your finances have started to take on a life of their own, and while it can be considered a “good problem” to have, it doesn’t make it feel any better. 
It’s like you’re on a never ending treadmill of money in and money out. Your financial advisor needs to be holistic in their thinking.


Too many opportunities to know what's best..
Energy, real estate, innovation, technology, healthcare, and economic outcomes of global pandemics are some of the substantial opportunities in today’s world, but not all of them are clear.
 You’re constantly being marketed to, and want a financial advisor you can trust to illuminate the truth, and give guidance specific to you.


Too little time to research & gain proficiency..
Just as you start to really understand a possible opportunity, another one presents itself or new information is discovered that rendered your opinion obsolete. It’s like the more you research, the less you understand.
 When you discuss these things with others, it seems like too personal of a conversation or you feel they’re exaggerating. Your financial needs to cut to the heart of the situation for you.


Too much stress to manage it all..
Your commitments and responsibilities don’t provide enough time to keep everything in order, on track, and moving towards your goals. You’re ready
 for a financial advisor, and guide who can help make this easier, help educate you, help empower you, and help propel you towards your goals.
You Deserve The Financial Freedom You've Earned. 
We help illuminate pathways for you to seize opportunity and be the hero everyone depends on - without the learning curve.

Frequently Asked Questions 


Will you have fiduciary responsibility?
Yes, we are held to a fiduciary standard to all clients whom formally engage with us to do financial planning & consulting. What we think goes very well with our fiduciary duties, are our contractual protections provided to clients. Our engagements are supervised by several regulating entities including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) help to ensure proper protection for clients & investors.


You are independent financial advisors and planners, but do you only sell proprietary products?
While financial products are the tools required for any wealth building journey, our only obligation is to do what’s best for our client. Our patent pending approach to planning is proprietary, and it includes components of financial product assessment, analysis, and selection using an established process. Built around what’s important to you, your plan may include products from both proprietary, and non-proprietary providers.


So how do I know if I'm a good fit?
That’s a great question! An important thing to note is that we can’t be all things to all people. Our specialty lies in holistic financial planning that’s intended to help professionals and business owners solve multi-faceted concerns with their financial future. In effect, we’re more valuable to clients who have more complex and complicated situations.


Why do you do what you do?
When we started AssetPRO, we were all Financial & Investment Advisors by training and have grown to include other professionals as well. We come from a variety of backgrounds in corporate financial institutions, and we came together to serve one specific purpose: To provide a lifetime financial planning solution that actually worked for a lifetime.


Do I need to replace my current professionals?
Not necessarily, we have a variety of ways that you can work with us for your financial planning needs. We plug-and-play with accountants, CPAs, attorneys, and nearly every other professional on your team.While we’re not in the relationship replacement business, we believe that the greater reach we have across your balance sheet to make improvements, the more effective we are. Our team model ensures you’ll always have multiple sets of eyes and years of diverse experience reviewing your situation. In the end, the choice is yours and we’ll design something on your terms.


How are you compensated?
Another great question! We’re compensated in a few different ways, but primarily by our planning consultative fees, investment & portfolio management fees, and with the placement of protection products like Life, Disability, and Health insurances. During onboarding, we spend time reviewing each and every cost associated with doing business with Asset Professional so you can feel comfortable, confident, and secure in your choice with us.


What kind of strategies do you implement?
We guide clients to utilize holistic strategies that are designed to consider their life as a whole.  Ultimately, our clients retain complete and total choice in their strategy – we just serve as the guides.


How much will this cost me?
We like to say that cost is only relevant in the absence of value. The price you pay will vary depending upon your strategy, your asset size, the work involved in optimizing, and the length of our relationship together. When we articulate our value, it’s always directly next to the cost so you can make an apples to apples comparison on the spot before you make any decisions.Explore our Pricing page for more info.


Do you work with only physicians and dentists?
We have a deep appreciation for the nuances of running a physician or dental practice, the toll it takes on the owner, and how little time they have to build their future. Physicians and dentists are our passion because of the immense value we can provide in one location – but finance is finance and regardless of your business, or profession if you’ve got some complexity to solve, we can help.


What if I own a non-medical business?
That’s completely fine, we’re well versed in the art of business consulting and equipped to help you solve your concerns. Our client base includes non-medical businesses in the industrial services, construction, nutrition supplements, real estate, contracting, legal, accounting, and finance industries with more being added each month!


What are your unique selling points (USP) ?
We’re committed to giving our clients the best experience they could possibly have. Through our use of technology we consolidate and integrate complex financial lives to begin planning. Our clients have access to their entire balance sheet and financial plan digitally, anywhere in the world. Using this facilitated approach to remote planning, we co-create a plan customized to your situation that will account for all known life-events, stated goals, and potential pitfalls on the road ahead. From there, we use data-driven insights to understand how you think and feel about money with our proprietary process. Finally, we use Nobel Prize winning concepts to de-risk your assets and help propel you toward your goals.All of this is backed by direct access & support, thoughtful onboarding, and candid conversations focused on what’s important to you. You can learn more about our process here.


Do you have any referrals I could speak to?
In today’s world, the testimonial has been watered down as marketing endeavors have blurred the lines between testimonials that are real, or aren’t. We also know that in speaking with our clients, that their situation could be completely different from yours. All that being said, we’re more than happy to provide referrals that can speak to our character, our approach, and our commitment.As one of the final elective steps in our process, once you’ve gotten all your questions answered and are ready to proceed, we’ll arrange time for you to connect with clients who can give you insight into their personal experience.


What happens after I fill the contact form out?
It’s pretty simple, we’ll give you a quick call to discuss your situation for 10-15 minutes.We won’t recommend any courses of action just yet, and the call is complimentary.We want to understand what’s important to you, and learn more about your situation from a high level. We’ll let you know right then and there if we think we’d be a good fit for one another and we’ll set up a web conference, or in-person meeting with the team to discuss solutions with you.
