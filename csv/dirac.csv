                                    On a daily basis we use Dirac software in our development, which enables us to reach our very high targets on audio quality.

                                    I was completely amazed by the difference that Dirac made to my new studio. My speakers are great but have several acoustic issues in my new studio resulting in the mixes not translating as expected, it was a friend who recommended I try Dirac. Now everything sounds just right!… significantly more accurate across the whole frequency range plus the imaging is incredible
