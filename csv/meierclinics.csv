Counselors who speak your language.Our team of psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists is experienced in almost every area of mental health and therapy, and we provide counseling care to individuals, couples, and families in a safe environment.

Since 2001, we have provided around $850,000 in charitable counseling and medical care annually as generous individuals and organizations who share our vision have helped to fund the Christian care provided by Meier Clinics.
On behalf of those who will be receiving quality Christian counseling because you cared, we want to sayÂ âThank you.âÂ Your generous gift will go to help someone who otherwise could not afford Christian mental health care services.
