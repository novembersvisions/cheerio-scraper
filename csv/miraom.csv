ABOUT ME
Mira is a seeker of the deeper truths of life..
Holistic Counselor and Lifestyle Coach
I use the holistic approach to support the mind-body-spirit’s return to homeostasis and wellness. Combining inner awareness, with mental counselling and bodycare is the key. 
Your sessions are unique to yourself. Start with holistic counselling to reduce stress and mood disorder. Then level up with bodycare and lifestyle therapy to enhance emotional and physical wellness. An empowering combination! 
Or would you like to enquire into astropsychology, see what the stars have to say to you?
You can go much deeper and further, as you desire!
Mira
