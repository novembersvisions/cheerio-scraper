 1000% would recommend this great little gem of pharmacy!!  Wasif and his staff are super helpful and efficient in filling my prescription.  My son needed a compound for his reflux and this pharmacy does compounds!  FIlling the prescription was fast and I missed out on some insurance information but they were able to gather the information via text and free delivery of the medication!  I was stuck at home with my newborn so I'm so glad this pharmacy is in my neighborhood!

 Can’t say enough good things about this pharmacy! They will go out of their way so they can meet you at a time that works for you even if they’re closed.

 I recently switched to this Pharmacy because of Wasif's expertise in pain management. He was the only pharmacist who came up with a plan to taper me off one of my meds.In addition to this, my meds are delivered when I need them. I have never had to wait. Amber is also awesome. She asked my doctor permission to release one of my medication early when my doctor is away.  I never have to worry about going without.Both Wasif and Amber provide excellent patient care. I have never been so impressed with a pharmacy.

 I came to know about this pharmacy during the pandemic when I saw in social media that they are giving out essential kits in our neighborhood.  When I called, Wasif personally delivered the kit.  Since then I have been getting my medicines from them and very often Wasif offered to deliver them to me.  The people at ICare are very accommodating and helpful. They really go beyond normal customer service.  I would from time to time message Wasif for questions and advice on health issues and he takes time to explain things to me and offer valuable advice.  He is a friend rather than a pharmacist to me.  Thank you ICare, thank you so much Wasif.

 I had switched to ICARE due to terrible customer service I was getting at my previous pharmacy. I am very glad I did. I even switched my parents from their pharmacy to ICARE. Great staff, always friendly. They also offer delivery service. They go over everything with you, always make sure your questions are answered. They never hesitate to go the extra mile. Thank you Wasif, and staff for the great customer service.

 My family and I have been using ICare pharmacy for just under 2 years now and could not be happier with the service that Wasif and his team have provided us! Prior to coming to ICare pharmacy we used big box pharmacies such as shoppers drug mart where your often times just a number and there is no personalized care. Our first Christmas with them was a true comparison to that when we received a personalized Christmas cards with our families names and acknowledgement to our son who was not yet born wishing us the best throughout the holidays and into the new year, with treats that accompanied it. Anytime I have a question or concern I text or call Wasif and he is always there to answer and give his advice. From after hours deliveries, to showing true compassion in what you do and always caring; thank you for showing us the perfect example of what a business should be! I could not recommend this business enough, as they are true experts in everything they do.
